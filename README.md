# Portfolio
This is my initial portfolio.  The content includes my current information, an about me page, as well as a presentation
that I initiated while working with Cisco.  The "Leadership" Deck as I call it, profiles experience and goals. This presentation was given during my Director's meeting in order to encourage others to use this as a tool during their skip level and other meetings.

## Projects Profiled
Backpack - An application designed to search hiking trails. Using various API's the user can search and retrieve not only trails, but location, and distance.

Liri - This application is a work in progress.  It is designed to allow users to pull information on concerts, movies, and songs.  The initial app code was inadvertantly changed.  The current status is pending.

Friend Finder - Friend finder allows users to submit a survey in order to find compatible friends in the area.  The application uses javascript code, that when run in jsbin will construct a new array and perform a match for the user.

SoundMonster - This is an exciting project that allows users to select from a range of instruments to play. The inspiration stems from keeping music in education.  Users can play a variety of tones alone or with a group.
